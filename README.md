#I have one job.

I will run your jobs ONCE. I have one job, and only one job.

Schedule your one time jobs with me. Don't be too complicated though, I'm not THAT smart. Try to stick to one-liners or something, I mean who do you think I am?

##How do I work?
I use At. If you use Windows, that sucks. I told you I wasn't very smart.

##What requirements do I have?
I use Ruby 1.9.3 or higher and need the Sinatra gem. What, did you think I could do this all by myself?

I am available through the MIT license. It's not like I do that much anyways.
